## 🌱 Greenhouse Gas Emission Prediction

This project analyzes and predicts greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from U.S. industries and commodities using supply chain data from [data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/supply-chain-greenhouse-gas-emission-factors-for-us-industries-and-commodities).

### 📁 Dataset Source
- **Title:** Supply Chain Emission Factors for US Industries and Commodities
- **Format:** Excel (.xlsx)
- **Years Covered:** 2010–2016

### 🔧 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

### 🚀 Objectives
- Download and preprocess the GHG dataset
- Merge and clean commodity and industry data
- Build regression models to predict emission factors
- Evaluate models using RMSE, MAE, and R²
